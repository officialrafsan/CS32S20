By `function field` we'll be able to know what type of operation we have to like add,sub etc. `destination operand` is the register where output will be stored. `first and second operand` are the first and second source operand respectively. `shift amount` field is only used for left/right shift and you have to specify the amount of shift here. So it's always 0 if you aren't doing left/right shift.\n",
