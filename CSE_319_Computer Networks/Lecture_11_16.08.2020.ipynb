    "IPv4 has 4 octets arranged in 4 orientation of network and host. Thus there are four classes in IPv4. In lab we have seen how to design VLSM given a base address. That method was very time consuming. In this lecture we'll see a shortcut method to design VLSM and also we'll see if a host ip address is given then how can we calculate network, subnet, broadcast address and usable host range.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here the ip  can given in two form either 14.12.15.17/19 (19 network host) or 14.12.15.17 & 255.255.224.0 (referring to 19 network host). In the second type as subnet is given then we need to only calculate other factors.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let assume 14.12.15.17/19 we are given this and need to calculate all other factors. First we'll see the long approach then shortcut.\n",

    "- Calculate subnet \n",
    "\n",
    "Lets calculate subnet mask first. As there are just 19 bit so there'll be 19 '1' and 13 '0' s.  \n",

    "\n",
    "![image.png](figures/fig212.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "Next step is we'll do bitwise AND operation between this binary conversion of host address and binary conversion of subnet mask. If we do AND operation between host and subnet we'll always get network address. So after that we can convert the binary result of the AND operation to decimal to get the network address.\n",

    "Previously we have done AND operation between the whole host address and subnet mask. As the network is 19bit so 1st 2 octets will always be 1 and in 3rd octet there'll be 1s and 0s. So as the 1st 2 octets are all 1 then we don't need to do AND operation between first 2 octets of host address and subnet. So the network address of first 2 octets will remain the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "15.17 & 224.0 = 00001111.00010001 & 11100000.000000000 = 00000000.00000000 = 0.0\n",

    "- Calculate broadcast address\n",
    "\n",
    "We calculate broadcast address by just doing one's compliment to only host address. So we'll use shortcut method here also. As the first 2 octets are network we'll keep them as it is. 3rd octet has both network and host address. network address is 14.12.0.0 here first 2 octets are network and 3rd octet has 3 network bits. Rest of the bit are for host so we do one's compliment on them.\n",

    "Another example. \n",

    "Here first 3 octets will remain the same as these octets has all 1s or 255 in their subnet. So we do AND operation only between 68 and 192. So we get network address 200.128.50.01 000000=200.128.50.64 and if do one's compliment on the host part of the network address we get, 200.128.50.01 111111=200.128.50.127 \n",
